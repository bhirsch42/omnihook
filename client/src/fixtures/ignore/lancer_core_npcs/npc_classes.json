Their Seeking weapons ignore cover and don’t require line of sight, allowing them to deal consistent damage. Relatively low HP makes Aces vulnerable to sustained damage, and they are relatively weak against tech attacks."

Chassis configured to the parameters of this class are usually positioned in fortified positions miles behind the line; one especially asymmetrical deployment strategy involves placing Bombard batteries above the theater of operations – typically on a local moon, locked-orbit natural satellite, or on a purpose-built orbital platform. From their vantage point, the battery can then rain shells down upon the world below, far removed from the dangers of combat.",

Their use is common within organizations for which the ends justify the means. Pyros are well-armored, and better insulated than most chassis of similar gross weight, designed to manage incredible internal heat while projecting volatile mixes of chemicals and flame toward their enemies.

If players don’t keep their distance, Pyros can use Explosive Vent to dump an enormous amount of heat on right on them.

Note, however, that players can move around shields to reduce their effectiveness to zero, or they can deactivate them by hitting Pyros with Stunned or Knockback weapons."
